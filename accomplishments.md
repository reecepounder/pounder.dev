# accomplishments
#### an incomplete list of the notable things i've done, dating back to when I first started getting into computers.

* 2012
  * I worked for my local parish (church region?) council, where I processed digital advertisements for them. I was 8 at the time, and I worked amongst a team of adults who were probably all 60 years old or more.

* 2014
 * I ran an ICT club with my friends at my elementary school and taught my classmates HTML and Scratch programming.

* 2016
  * I became the go-to technical support person in my middle school, where teachers would routinely call me out of class to help fix issues with projectors, smart boards, laptops, and other technologies.

* 2017
  * I worked on a Roblox game development team to produce a project that gained over 100,000 visits in 7 months. Some celebrities in that particular genre played the game and published videos on it, and it spawned a small community of fans. It was shut down due to copyright issues.
 
* 2019

  * I worked in my school's broadcast studio, where I became familiar with modern broadcast television production methods, Adobe Premiere Pro, NewTek TriCaster, and more. I also worked on their live production team using similar technologies where I devleoped my leadership skills, technical understanding of the production workflow, and camera skills.
  * I achieved the CompTIA Security+ certification at 16 years old.
