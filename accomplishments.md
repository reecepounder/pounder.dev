# accomplishments
#### an incomplete list of the notable things i've done, dating back to when I first started getting into computers.

* 2012
  * I worked for my local parish (church region?) council, where I processed digital advertisements for them. I was 8 at the time, and I worked amongst a team of adults who were probably all 60 years old or more.

* 2014
 * I ran an ICT club with my friends at my elementary school and taught my classmates HTML and Scratch programming.

* 2016
  * I became the go-to technical support person in my middle school, where teachers would routinely call me out of class to help fix issues with projectors, smart boards, laptops, and other technologies.

* 2017
  * I worked on a Roblox game development team to produce a project that gained over 100,000 visits in 7 months. Some celebrities in that particular genre played the game and published videos on it, and it spawned a small community of fans. It was shut down due to copyright issues.
 
* 2019
  * I passed the Cambridge International A-Level exam on Information Technology. I did this through self-study, as opposed to the typical 1 year of intense coursework provided by my school.
  * I achieved the Microsoft Word and Powerpoint certifications.

* 2020
  * I worked in my school's broadcast studio, where I became familiar with modern broadcast television production methods, Adobe Premiere Pro, NewTek TriCaster, and more. I also worked on their live production team using similar technologies where I devleoped my leadership skills, technical understanding of the production workflow, and camera skills.
  * I achieved the CompTIA Security+ certification at 16 years old.
  * I got a 5 on the AP Computer Science A exam.
  
* 2021
  * I achieved the CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications at 16 years old
  * I achieved the Microsoft Excel certification
  * I achieved the Google IT support credential certifying my competency in troubleshooting, customer service, networking, operating systems, system administration, security, and data management.
  * I worked at Toyota of North Miami over the summer as a salesman (internship)
  * I was hired at a Code Ninjas 'Dojo', where I taught 7-14 year olds how to code Scratch, Javascript, Roblox Lua, and more.
  * I started pursuing my IT support side-hobby professionally under the name Pounder IT

* 2022
  * I left CodeNinjas
  * I graduated high school
  * I won the regional, state and national level cybersecurity competitions hosted by SkillsUSA, against 17 other teams (read my blog posts about them)
  * I was a beta-tester for the next CompTIA CySA exam (CS0-003)

* 2023
  * I started at Broward College studying my AS in Cybersecurity (skipped most of my classes thanks to the certifications I have.)

That's pretty much it. My full life story. Some day I'll regret putting this on the internet - if you're reading this on archive.org in the future: hi!
