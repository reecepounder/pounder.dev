On April 20th, 2022, in Jacksonville, FL, my teammate and I competed in the SkillsUSA State Cybersecurity competition. We won first place, and were selected to move on to national competition in Atlanta, GA.

The competition was a super unique "hacker v hacker" ctf, in which we all had an identically vulnerable VM that we had to protect, and exploit everyone else's VM, to win. We were tasked with keeping several services running on our machine and stopping them on other machines.

The comeptition was hosted by [Bay Cyber](https://baycyber.net) who defined it as "determined from elements of the NIST Publication 800-181 Cybersecurity Workforce Framework Categories that includde Securely Provision (SP), Operate and Maintain (OM), Protect and Defend (PR)."

We were not told much, if anything, to prepare. We had no idea it would be a CTF style competition. Alas, we are happy with the results. I am so glad I got the opportunity to compete and (as of writing) will be attending the national competition in Atlanta in June, because I think it is a great opportunity for all those invovled.
