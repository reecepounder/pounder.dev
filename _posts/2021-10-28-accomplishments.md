## I thought I'd summarize a list of everything I've done, ever, that is of note. Just to provide some base line to prove how long I've had a passion for computers, for helping others, for learning more, and for doing other stuff.

* 2012
  * I worked for the local parish (church region?) council, where I processed digital advertisements for them. I was 8 at the time, and I worked amongst a team of adults while doing so.
* 2014 

* 2017
  * I worked on a Roblox game development team that produced a project that gained over 100,000 visits in 7 months and was visited by celebrities in the space.
 
* 2019
  * I passed the Cambridge International A-Level exam on Information Technology by self-studying and research, as opposed to the typical 1 year of intense coursework provided in school.
  * I got certified in Microsoft Office Word and Powerpoint.

* 2020
  * I worked in my school's broadcast studio, where I became familiar with modern broadcast television production methods, Adobe Premiere Pro, NewTek TriCaster, and more. I also worked on their live production team using similar technologies where I devleoped my leadership skills, technical understanding of the production workflow, and camera skills.
  * I achieved the CompTIA Security+ certification at 16 years old.
  * I got a 5 on the AP Computer Science A exam.
  
* 2021
  * I achieved the CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications at 16 years old
  * I got certified in Microsoft Office Excel.
  * I achieved a Google IT support credential certifying my competency in troubleshooting, customer service, networking, operating systems, system administration, security, and data management.
    * Note: the Google IT support credential is a 6-month online course, that I completed within 7 days during the courses free trial and therefore took the exam for free.
  * I worked at Toyota of North Miami over the summer as a salesman (internship)
  * I was hired at Code Ninjas of Cooper City, where I currently work, teaching 7-14 year olds how to code Scratch, Javascript, Roblox Lua, and more.

  This list is _incomplete_. My resume provides a more detailed explanantion of the notable accomplishments, so please have a read of that.
