I made a bot that spams a Google Form.

The original purpose for this project was to experiment with Selenium, the browser framework. I'd wanted to try it on something more complex, but making a sneaker sniping bot wasn't feasable at the time. So, next best alternative, was rigging a Google Form poll for superlative voting at my high school. (most likely to <x> style)
  
This experiment was an interesting view into how the Selenium tools work, and I have a few ideas of how I want to implement them in the future.
  - Automatic purchasing
  - Manual task automation
  - Automatic submission of web form
